## What is Vime?

Vime is an open-sourced library focused on giving users and developers the best possible media player
experience on the web. The idea behind Vime is **we want you to control the player, not the other way around**. 
We built all of Vime with that in mind. Thus, we focus on normalizing cross-browser and provider differences, 
all powered by an reactive/eventful store, modular design, powerful plugin system and much more.

## Offerings

The following is a brief summary of what packages Vime contains and what they can offer. Please
keep in mind that this is **super simplified** and each package is full of treats.

- **Preview:** displays custom or provider loaded thumbnails.
- **Lite:** lightweight and super powerful media embed at half the cost of traditional player SDK's.
- **Standard:** extends Lite with our core player interface that normalizes browser and provider
  differences and gives you access to the store.
- **Complete:** this is our greatest offering which extends Lite and Standard with the ability
  to completely customize the player via plugins. We have a long list of plugins we've created already 
  for custom controls, settings, tooltips and more!

## Provider Support

- [Html5][mdn-media-element]
- [Hls][hls-github]
- [Dash][dash-github]
- [YouTube][youtube-player]
- [Vimeo][vimeo-player]
- [Dailymotion][dailymotion-player]

[dailymotion-player]: https://developer.dailymotion.com/player/

## Browser Support

Vime is focused on supporting the last 2 versions of all modern browsers and IE 11.

- [x] Safari
- [x] iOS Safari
- [x] Firefox
- [x] Chrome
- [x] Opera
- [x] Edge
- [ ] IE 11 (most likely broken at the moment as no testing has been performed on it)

## Motivation

The main issue with alternative solutions like [Videojs][github-videojs] and [Plyr][github-plyr] is:

* They are **not modular/treeshakable** and come with too many built-in features that most users simply don't need. This 
bloats the package size and the final bundle includes useless code.

* Poor **plugin ecosystem** or none at all. Plyr doesn't have a plugin system which makes it difficult
for the community or devs to extend the player. Videojs has mostly basic plugins and a majority are outdated
or not actively maintained. 

* **Poor multi-provider support.** Plyr only supports Vimeo and YouTube at this time and there
is no simple way to add a custom provider. Videojs supports multiple providers through custom `Tech`
but there is technically none supported out of the box. The community plugins 
that add support for them are outdated and don't work (see [videojs-youtube](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-youtube/issues/547) 
and [videojs-vimeo](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-vimeo/issues/151)).

* Both libraries use **Player SDKs** to integrate each provider which causes additional bloat. Each SDK is 
repeating mostly the same code for mounting and building the `iframe`, cleaning event listeners etc. 
Each can weigh as much as ~10 kB. Thus, after adding only 3 providers such as YouTube, Dailymotion and 
Vimeo you'll incur an additional 25 - 30 kB overhead.

* **Poor documentation**. This is mostly directed at Videojs, their documentation feels clunky and
difficult to navigate and understand.

* Lack of **testing**. Videojs has a good set of unit tests but no e2e tests, and Plyr has no tests at all. 
This makes both libraries vulnerable to breakage. I'll admit Vime has no tests just yet either, 
but it is one of our highest priorities.

* They are not built with modern **UI framework** capabilities. We've learnt a lot about building user interfaces
over the last decade. It's best to not reinvent the wheel and use existing frameworks. Most importantly, they help with
providing structure, solutions to common problems, code reusability, improved development experience 
and a quicker time-to-contribute (time it takes a dev to understand a new codebase and contribute). Plyr and 
Videojs are completely Vanilla JS. This was likely a conscious decision to make sure the libraries are interoperable between 
JS frameworks. However, a new wave of [compile-time frameworks](https://peteroshaughnessy.com/posts/disappearing-frameworks/) 
like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) and [Ember](https://emberjs.com/)
are reducing the costs of choosing to use a framework. Two examples of how not using a framework affects Videojs and Plyr is:

  * Videojs decided to design its own [Component](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/blob/master/src/js/component.js) class 
  for managing UI state. Besides the fact that it's 1700 lines of code, it's hard to build anything meaningful with it. 
  If you're intending on building complex UI components/plugins for your player, then you simply need to find your own recipe for 
  making it happen.

  * The codebase for Plyr is a jungle with logic tangled up all over the place. For example, understanding 
  [1700 lines of code](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/blob/master/src/js/controls.js) for just the controls 
  is simply too much.

## Features

* **Responsive Design.** The player and all our plugins are designed for mobile, touch and larger screens.

* **Accessible.** All controls and menus are built with accessibility in mind, and VTT captions are supported.

* **Options.** There is an option for whatever your use case. Thumbnails preview, lite player embed, standard
player for a normalized experience, and a complete system with plugins and all.

* **Lightweight.** 0 external dependencies, modular, treeshakable, no additional SDK's loaded for embeds, and compiled with 
Svelte to have the smallest footprint possible. Sizes ranging from 5.5 kB (min + gzip) up to everything 
included at 54 kB (min + gzip).

* **Avoid browser inconsistencies.** Browsers each approach new API's differently and this can be quite
a headache. Vime handles it all so you don't. Enjoy fullscreen, picture-in-picture and more without 
any pain.

* **Multi-provider support.** Don't bother learning a new SDK everytime, just use Vime!

* **Reactive/eventful store.** Behind the scences, all properties are a store. Subscribe to anything you
like and receive updates in realtime.

* **I18n.** Internationalization is built right in. Easy to add, extend and change as needed. English
is provided out of the box and more languages to come.

* **Portable.** The final bundle is Vanilla JS, use it anywhere you like. For an even better experience 
we'll be building framework intergations starting with React and Vue.

* **Lazy loading.** All players are loaded lazily as soon as they are almost in view.

* **Preconnections.** Thanks to [`rel='preconnect'`][css-tricks-preconnect] we can establish a network connection
early to increase rendering speed of embedded media by up to [224x][youtube-embed-comparison].

* **Design**. A minimalistic, modern and sleek design which you can customize with your own icons and theme. See
screenshots above for our base design.

* **Modular Design + Plugin System.** Include only the parts you need and benefit from treeshaking to remove the 
waste. Outside of the core, everything is built as a plugin so you can integrate only what you need. There are 
plugins for Keyboard shortcuts, Controls, Tooltips, Settings and much more. There is even a handy Boot plugin, if you want 
to use everything with no additional setup required. The plugin system utilizes `svelte:component` so you can extend 
the player with the full power of Svelte.

* **Built with Svelte.** Enjoy great performance and smaller bundles thanks to Svelte. If you're using 
Vime inside a Svelte project, we've provided a `svelte` key so you can compile the player yourself 
and share the same Svelte internals. This will reduce the overhead cost of Vime, and you get all the 
benefits of auto-subscriptions since all props are powered by a store.

* **Complete control**. Remember, we want you to control the player, not the other way around. We've
built all of Vime with that in mind. Pick what you want, extend what you want, interact with what you want, 
pretty much do whatever you want easily.

## Warnings

- If you're looking for something that has battled the test of time and is reliable today in a 
large production app, then Vime is not for you. You should go ahead and checkout [Videojs][github-videojs] 
and [Plyr][github-plyr]. 

- IE 11 has not been tested at all. There will definitely be bugs. If this is important to you, then don't use Vime in production just yet.
